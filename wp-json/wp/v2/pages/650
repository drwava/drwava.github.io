As someone who has delved into the world of voodoo and witch craft, I can attest to the fact that these practices are not to be taken lightly. With great power comes great responsibility, and it\u2019s essential to approach these practices with caution and respect. Whether you\u2019re casting spells or performing rituals, always remember that your intentions and actions carry significant weight. The energy you put out into the universe will come back to you, so be mindful and respectful in your practice.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-03200df elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"03200df\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Voodoo Spells, Black Magic and Me.<\/h2>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1a76b5b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1a76b5b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you\u2019ve read my \u2018about me\u2019 page you\u2019ll know that I have identified with the term \u2018witch\u2019 since my teens. Magick and Spells have come naturally to me for as long as I can remember. I decided to purchase a book on Voodoo to deepen my understanding.<\/p><p>But back in my twenties I went off in search of answers to questions I didn\u2019t even know I had. Voodoo had always intrigued me so I looked for a Voodoo Priestess near me. I was in New York so there was bound to be one close by, right? Nope. I found a paperback edition of a comprehensive guide on Voodoo spells which was quite accessible.<\/p><p>Huh. Maybe Voodoo is more of a man thing? I googled \u2018Voodoo Priest near me.\u2019 Nothing.<\/p><p>Clearly Voodoo wasn\u2019t going to come to me. But I was too curious to let it go. Clearly, a bit of travelling was in order.<\/p><p>I cast a Fortune Spell, pumped it\u2019s energy up every day and within a few months I was on my way to meet a real life Haitian Voodoo Priest \u2013 well, if you\u2019re going to learn, you want to learn from the best, right?<\/p><p>He was so lovely, and he kindly took me under his wing. You can request Jean Emmanuel\u2019s contact details directly from me.<\/p><p>He taught me all about the different Spirits; The Loa.<\/p><p>He taught me that they aren\u2019t like angels &#8211; they are Spirits with Attitude! Each has their own personality, likes and dislikes. They have their own symbols and ways in which they like to be \u2018thanked.\u2019 For example, to make sure you don\u2019t get seasick or run aground on the cruise you would work with the Loa Agwe. The only way to call him during a Voodoo Ritual is with a conch shell, and even then you must make sure you have plenty of wet sponges and towels around to protect Agwe from the heat when he leaves his watery habitat. And that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026\u2026<\/p><p>After many months of tutelage (which totally blew my mind) I finally had my answer. I knew the difference between Voodoo Spells and Black Magic Spells!<\/p><p>Answer: Next to nothing!<\/p><p>There is virtually no difference at all. Voodoo Priests and Priestesses call upon Voodoo forces (The Loa), whereas I call upon The Spirits. But in reality, they\u2019re the same guys.<\/p><p>Voodoo Spells might be cast using a different set of rituals. They might be worded differently and use different items to represent people, or their hopes and dreams &#8211; but at the end of the day they have the SAME intent as Black Magic Spells.<\/p><p>Voodoo and Witchcraft are just different perspectives of the same thing.<\/p><p>Asking which one is more powerful, or better, or more likely to work, is like asking someone if watercolours or oil paint are better \u2013 in reality it\u2019s the person holding the paint brush that really counts. Both can be used to create a beautiful landscape.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-598687a elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"598687a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Should you pick Black Magic or Voodoo?

I get asked all sorts of questions about Black Magic, spells, what I do and how it works, but surprisingly, one question that comes up time and time again, is this: Which is more powerful? A Voodoo Spell or a Black Magic Spell?\u2019 And the answer is\u2026 Complicated. And yet, also simple. To fully answer the question, we really need to understand what Voodoo actually is and why it is important to be careful when engaging with these practices. What exactly is Voodoo in terms of spirituality? Voodoo is actually a religion. In Haiti it\u2019s huge! Like other religions there is a God, but Voodoo followers can\u2019t talk to him directly. They have to talk to him via the Voodoo forces &amp; spirits known as The Loa. Voodoo invites individuals to open their minds to a deeper understanding of magic and the mystical, thus emphasizing its connection to spirituality. The Loa are pretty powerful, and depending on who\u2019s asking, they\u2019re sometimes able to grant requests. Does Voodoo Magic involve animal sacrifice and other scary stuff? To keep The Loa happy, \u2018Thank You\u2019 rituals and ceremonies can sometimes involve animal sacrifice, but they really don\u2019t have to. If you were a spirit would you want to see an innocent animal murdered in front of you? What would be the point? Fair warning: engaging in these powerful rituals and ceremonies can have serious consequences. Are Voodoo Priests possessed? Those images of Voodoo Priests and Priestesses being \u2018possessed\u2019 aren\u2019t made up \u2013 sometimes, it does happen. The Loa are invited to enter the body of the Voodoo Priest so that they can communicate with us mere mortals. It is considered a real honour to be chosen. Most times though a Voodoo Priest or Priestess communicates with The Loa (the Voodoo forces and spirits) through ritual and meditation, thoughts and feelings. These practices are often performed in specific ways to ensure proper communication. This is much the same way that I work When I communicate with the Spirits I see them, and I hear them &#8211; but they don\u2019t take over my body and start me dancing around the room. It\u2019s far more relaxing than that. I do the equivalent of having coffee and cake with the Spirit world. Voodoo Spells, Black Magic, and Me Voodoo spells and black magic have long been shrouded in mystery and intrigue. While some view them as taboo or even evil, others see them as a means to tap into the unknown and harness its power. As someone who has delved into the world of voodoo and witch craft, I can attest to the fact that these practices are not to be taken lightly. With great power comes great responsibility, and it\u2019s essential to approach these practices with caution and respect. Whether you\u2019re casting spells or performing rituals, always remember that your intentions and actions carry significant weight. The energy you put out into the universe will come back to you, so be mindful and respectful in your practice. Voodoo Spells, Black Magic and Me. If you\u2019ve read my \u2018about me\u2019 page you\u2019ll know that I have identified with the term \u2018witch\u2019 since my teens. Magick and Spells have come naturally to me for as long as I can remember. I decided to purchase a book on Voodoo to deepen my understanding. But back in my twenties I went off in search of answers to questions I didn\u2019t even know I had. Voodoo had always intrigued me so I looked for a Voodoo Priestess near me. I was in New York so there was bound to be one close by, right? Nope. I found a paperback edition of a comprehensive guide on Voodoo spells which was quite accessible. Huh. Maybe Voodoo is more of a man thing? I googled \u2018Voodoo Priest near me.\u2019 Nothing. Clearly Voodoo wasn\u2019t going to come to me. But I was too curious to let it go. Clearly, a bit of travelling was in order. I cast a Fortune Spell, pumped it\u2019s energy up every day and within a few months I was on my way to meet a real life Haitian Voodoo Priest \u2013 well, if you\u2019re going to learn, you want to learn from the best, right? He was so lovely, and he kindly took me under his wing. You can request Jean Emmanuel\u2019s contact details directly from me. He taught me all about the different Spirits; The Loa. He taught me that they aren\u2019t like angels &#8211; they are Spirits with Attitude! Each has their own personality, likes and dislikes. They have their own symbols and ways in which they like to be \u2018thanked.\u2019 For example, to make sure you don\u2019t get seasick or run aground on the cruise you would work with the Loa Agwe. The only way to call him during a Voodoo Ritual is with a conch shell, and even then you must make sure you have plenty of wet sponges and towels around to protect Agwe from the heat when he leaves his watery habitat. And that\u2019s just the beginning\u2026\u2026 After many months of tutelage (which totally blew my mind) I finally had my answer. I knew the difference between Voodoo Spells and Black Magic Spells! Answer: Next to nothing! There is virtually no difference at all. Voodoo Priests and Priestesses call upon Voodoo forces (The Loa), whereas I call upon The Spirits. But in reality, they\u2019re the same guys. Voodoo Spells might be cast using a different set of rituals. They might be worded differently and use different items to represent people, or their hopes and dreams &#8211; but at the end of the day they have the SAME intent as Black Magic Spells. Voodoo and Witchcraft are just different perspectives of the same thing. Asking which one is more powerful, or better, or more likely to work, is like asking<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"elementor_header_footer","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-650","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/650","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=650"}],"version-history":[{"count":43,"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/650\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1121,"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/650\/revisions\/1121"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/vuhdu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=650"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
